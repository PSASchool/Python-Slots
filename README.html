<p>Starting the slot machine is simple. Simply double click on the &quot;Run Slot Machine&quot; icon on your desktop.</p>
<p>If for some reason the Desktop launcher is not working, you can run the game with <code>python3 ~/Python-Slots/slotmachine/Python-Slots/SlotMachine.py</code>.</p>

<p>The goal of the slot machine game is to take home as many rupees as possible by gambling your way to victory.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>When you start the game, you will have to make a deposit. This deposit is locked at 50 rupees. The deposit is how much money you put into the pot. The pot is how much money you have. You may bet as much money as you want, as long as your bet doesn't exceed the pot. When the pot reaches zero, the game ends and you must try again.</p>
<p>When you bet, you may lose or gain money based on a random multiplier.</p>

<p>Clicking the &quot;Cash Out&quot; button will end the game and send your pot to the scoreboard. You are then free to try again to get a higher score.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The scoreboard does not keep track of high scores! If you send a low score to the scoreboard, it will overwrite your previous score, even if your previous score was higher! You cannot undo sending your score.</p>
