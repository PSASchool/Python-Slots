# The Slot Machine Application
This small wiki goes over what the slot machine application is, and how to use it. **Make sure to read the [rules](#Rules)!**

## How to Start the Slot Machine
Starting the slot machine is simple. Simply double click on the "Run Slot Machine" icon on your desktop.

## Goal
The goal of the slot machine game is to take home as many rupees as possible by gambling your way to victory.

## How to Play
When you start the game, you will have to make a deposit. This deposit is locked at 50 rupees. The deposit is how much money you put into the pot. The pot is how much money you have. You may bet as much money as you want, as long as your bet doesn't exceed the pot. When the pot reaches zero, the game ends and you must try again.

When you bet, you may lose or gain money based on a random multiplier.

## How to Send Your Score
Clicking the "Cash Out" button will end the game and send your pot to the scoreboard. You are then free to try again to get a higher score.

**Note:** The scoreboard does not keep track of high scores! If you send a low score to the scoreboard, it will overwrite your previous score, even if your previous score was higher! You cannot undo sending your score.

## Rules
1. Hacking the game itself is allowed, but simply changing the sent score is not allowed.
2. Deleting or modification of the admin-tools folder (or any of it's files) or disabling ssh is not allowed. It will result in disqualification.
3. Changing of scoring systems or other systems that identify your team information is not recommended as your score will not be sent to the scoreboard.
4. You may not change any user settings.
